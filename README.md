# MED-MNG Backend

This repository contains the backend services for the MED-MNG project.
The project is being migrated to a monorepo structure using pnpm workspaces.

## Quick Start

```bash
pnpm install
supabase start
pnpm dev
```

The `pnpm dev` script will launch the API and worker locally.

## Monorepo Structure

See `README_REFACTORED.md` for the refactoring plan and directory layout.
